## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1.0 | :x:                |

Vulnerabilities in 3rd party software are not supported, we will do our best to pass on your message
but it will be better to contact the maintainers or vendors directly.
