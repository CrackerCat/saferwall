# Byte and Entropy Statistics for Binary Files

This module implements byte and entropy extract for binary files
it is loosely based on [Deep Neural Network Based Malware Detection Using Two Dimensional Binary Program Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.03096.pdf).

This module outputs byte historgram statistics and 2D byte & entropy statistics over byte
values in a binary file.
